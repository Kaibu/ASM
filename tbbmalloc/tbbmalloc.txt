... this is a experimental replacement for armas default memory allocator.
It is designed to work on 64bit OS with at least 8GB RAM. 


HOW TO USE:

Copy tbbmalloc.dll in your arma3/dll directory.
append -malloc=tbbmalloc to your arma 3 start line.

tbbmalloc is using RAM in large pages (2048kB instead of 4kB, 2000 pages are preallocated at arma process start).

The use of large pages require the page lock privilege for the arma user.

Make sure your arma user account has this privilege set in you local security policies settings (resatrt required) and start arma with administrator rights.

This alternative memory allocator is based of the latest intel tbb_malloc 4.2 and should work with arma server and client.

On client i measured up to 9% higher framerates with helos A3-bench. 
On server i have no benchmark, but it should accelerate here too a bit.
