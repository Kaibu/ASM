#Arma Server Monitor#

"Arma Server Monitor" is a spin-off of my experiments with the arma engine.

----------

Propertys:

	- monitors up to 4 server (or headless client) instances simultaneous 
	- introduces a performance value CPS for FSM processing analysis
	- very simple, compact and solid design
	- almost no influence to cpu load
	- easy to use (mini addon)
	- customizable history graphs	

----------

Currently able to monitor the following values:

	- PID process ID of the server instance
	- OBJ number of all objects in current mission (allMissionObjects)
	- MEM Amount of allocated physical memory
	- FPS (on a server this means simulation cycles per second)
	- FPSmin (the minimum FPS of the last 16 cycles, hist. graph only)
	- CPS Condition-evaluation per Second (rel. to AI response delay, VM load)
	- PL# Number of alive player units
	- AIL Number of alive server local AI units
	- AIR Number of alive AI units on connected machines (remote)
	- Name of the currently played mission (missionName)
	- Name of the instance profile (profileName)

----------

**Arma Server Monitor** consists of 3 components:

	fn_ASM.fsm 				- Reports some internal performance states from arma server (or HC)
	ASMdll.dll 				- Interfaces to ArmaServerMonitor.exe via shared memory
	ArmaServerMonitor.exe 	- The Monitor itself reads from MMF and displays the values

----------

Alongside to the well known FPS (frames per second), an very interesting value **CPS** is introduced here.    
**CPS** is expressed by **condition** **evalations** per **second** and measured from an reference condition in `fn_ASM.fsm`.   

You can realize this **CPS** value as the reciprocal of the current "minimal response delay" of AI in the running mission.    

Two example situations should illustrate the meaning of this value:   
In a first scenario, we are observing a CPS value of 10.0 condition evaluations per second. Here our AI has an minimal response delay of ca. 100ms (1000ms/10.0). That means everything runs well.         
In a second scenario we have a value of 0.5 CPS, what means AI has a **minimal** response delay larger than 2 seconds !!!    
Especially COOP missions running with such low **CPS** are really no pleasure. AI seems to be "stupid".   
 

Additional to the history graph of FPS values, now the value **FPSmin** is drawed as a graph.
By watching this graphs you can **easily spot lags** on your server, without being in game.

**How to use ASM:**

Extract this file: [https://github.com/fred41/ASM/blob/master/addon/ASM.zip](https://github.com/fred41/ASM/blob/master/addon/ASM.zip)    to your Arma 3 root folder.

Add **-mod=@ASM** to your server (or HC) launch params.     

Run `ArmaServerMonitor.exe` from what directory you want, to monitor all your server (or HC) instances locally.

(use right mouse button for popup menus, adapt your **asm.ini** file if you need object counting)     

**Additional**, it is now possible to **connect** to `Arma Server Monitor` **from remote** via TCP.   
To do that, you need an ASM instance on the remote device too and configure it per start params as client.   
Default start params for `ArmaServerMonitor.exe` are: `-server -n1 -h127.0.0.1 -p24000`   
This means, it starts per default as monitoring server and listens at TCP port 24000, max. allowed remote clients = 1.

Example for client configuration:   

    ArmaServerMonitor.exe -client -h201.178.1.102 -p24000

That means ASM starts as monitoring client and tries periodical to connect/read to/from your ASM  server at 201.178.1.102:24000.   
If your server is firewall protected, you have to open the selected TCP port on server.


**If you prefer to run your DS instance(s) as service, you have to start ArmaServerMonitor with admin rights**     

*ENJOY :)*
