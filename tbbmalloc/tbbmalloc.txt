... this is a experimental replacement for armas default memory allocator.
It is designed to work on 64bit OS with at least 8GB RAM. 


HOW TO USE:

Copy tbbmalloc.dll in your arma3/dll directory.
append -malloc=tbbmalloc to your arma 3 start line.

tbbmalloc is using RAM in large pages (2048kB instead of 4kB).
This require the page lock privilege for the arma user.

Make sure your arma user account has this privilege set (gpedit) and start arma with administrator rights.
